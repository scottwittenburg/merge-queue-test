# merge-queue-test

This is a home for experiments to help understand GitHub Merge Queue feature.

## Notes

Created a first PR, it went into a merge queue and was merged almost immediately.

Fetching from the repo later, there is a new branch:

```
gh-readonly-queue/main/pr-1-ffa88c5e89dc38200a2bd4459e74bfa12c09641d
```

That points to the same merge commit as `main`.
